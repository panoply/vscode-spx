Fired when a [CSS Animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) has started. If there is an [`animation-delay`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay), this event will fire once the delay period has expired. A negative delay will cause the event to fire with an [`elapsedTime`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnimationEvent/elapsedTime) equal to the absolute value of the delay (and, correspondingly, the animation will begin playing at that time index into the sequence).
