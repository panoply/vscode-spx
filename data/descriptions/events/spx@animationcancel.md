Fired when a [CSS Animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) unexpectedly aborts. In other words, any time it stops running without sending an [animationend](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationend_event) event. This might happen when the animation-name is changed such that the animation is removed, or when the animating node is hidden using CSS. Therefore, either directly or because any of its containing nodes are hidden.
